          Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is a type of fossil fuel, formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

          Here are some key features of the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020:
          Introduction of Auctions for Allocating Non-Coal Mines:
            The ordinance allowed the auctioning of mineral blocks for prospecting-cum-mining operations. Earlier, only coal mines were auctioned, and other minerals were allocated through a different process.
          No Requirement of Previous Approval for Transferring Mining Leases:
            The ordinance removed the requirement for previous approval in the transfer of mining leases. This aimed at facilitating the ease of doing business and encouraging investment in the mining sector.
          Extension of Leases for Captive Mines:
            For captive mines (mines dedicated to a specific end-use industry), the ordinance allowed the extension of mining leases beyond the original period without going through the auction process.
          Removal of Restrictions on End-use of Minerals:
            The ordinance removed the restriction on the use of minerals extracted from the mines. Earlier, certain minerals were allocated with specific end-use conditions.
          Introduction of Composite Prospecting Licenses-Cum-Mining Leases (PL-cum-ML):
            The ordinance introduced the concept of Composite Prospecting Licenses-Cum-Mining Leases, allowing seamless transition from prospecting to mining in a single license.
          Provision for Relaxation in Annual Cap on Iron Ore Production:
            The ordinance provided the flexibility to the state governments to increase the annual production cap for iron ore mines. This was aimed at addressing the varying iron ore needs of different states.
          Reconnaissance Permits and Prospecting Licenses to be Merged:
            Similar to the later amendment act, the ordinance allowed the merging of reconnaissance permits and prospecting licenses, simplifying the regulatory process.
          The Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, was later replaced by the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020, which was passed by the Parliament during its budget session. The act essentially ratified and converted the provisions of the ordinance into law.

          Here are the key features and provisions of the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1948:

            1.Provident Fund Scheme:The act establishes a Coal Mines Provident Fund and a Family Pension Scheme for the benefit of employees working in coal mines. The provident fund is designed to accumulate a fund to secure the future of the employees.

            2.Contributions:Both the employer and the employee make monthly contributions to the provident fund. The contributions are calculated as a percentage of the employee's basic wages, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance, if any.
          
            3.Contribution Rates:The act empowers the Central Government to determine the rates of contributions for both employers and employees. The rates are specified in the Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme.

            4.Administration:The administration and implementation of the Coal Mines Provident Fund Scheme are entrusted to a statutory body known as the Coal Mines Provident Fund Organization (CMPFO). The CMPFO is responsible for managing the funds and ensuring their proper utilization.

            5.Members' Accounts:Each member of the provident fund scheme has an individual account maintained by the CMPFO. The account reflects the contributions made by the member and the interest accrued on those contributions.

            6.Withdrawal and Advances:The act allows members to withdraw the accumulations in their provident fund accounts under specified circumstances, such as retirement, resignation, or permanent disability. Members can also avail of advances for certain purposes, like housing, marriage, education, etc.

            7.Insurance Scheme:In addition to the provident fund, the act provides for the establishment of a Coal Mines Family Pension Scheme. This scheme offers a life insurance-cum-pension benefit to the families of deceased employees.

            8.Adjudication and Appeals:The act establishes authorities for adjudicating disputes and hearing appeals related to the implementation of the provident fund and family pension schemes.

            9.Penalties:Provisions are laid out for penalties against employers who fail to pay the contributions or comply with the provisions of the act.

            10.Exemptions:The act provides the power to exempt certain classes of employees or employers from the operation of the provident fund and family pension schemes.

          The Coal Mines Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1948, thus play a crucial role in ensuring financial security and social welfare for coal mine workers and their families in India.

          The Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959, is an act of the Indian Parliament that was enacted to repeal the Coal Grading Board Act, 1959. The Coal Grading Board Act, 1959, had established the Coal Grading Board for the purpose of grading coal according to its quality. The subsequent repeal was likely due to changes in the regulatory framework or administrative requirements.

          Here are the key points related to the Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959:

            1.Objective:The primary objective of the Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959, was to repeal the Coal Grading Board Act, 1959, and dissolve the Coal Grading Board.

            2.Repeal of Earlier Act:The act repealed the Coal Grading Board Act, 1959, in its entirety. Repealing an earlier act means that the provisions and regulations outlined in the original act are annulled and no longer have legal effect.

            3.Dissolution of the Coal Grading Board:The Coal Grading Board, which was originally established for the purpose of grading coal, was dissolved as a result of the repeal. The dissolution could be attributed to changes in policies, administrative decisions, or the evolution of the coal industry's regulatory framework.

            4.Transition and Consequences:The act might have included provisions addressing the transitional aspects of the repeal. This could involve the transfer of responsibilities, assets, or functions of the Coal Grading Board to other entities or regulatory bodies.

            5.Effect on Grading of Coal:With the repeal of the Coal Grading Board Act, 1959, the specific mechanism for grading coal as outlined in that act ceased to be in force. Depending on subsequent legislative developments, coal grading responsibilities may have been assigned to other agencies or integrated into a different regulatory framework.

            6.Legal Implications:Repealing an act removes the legal basis for the existence and operation of the entity or framework established by that act. The legal consequences of the repeal are outlined in the Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959.

          The Coal Grading Board (Repeal) Act, 1959, reflects a legislative decision to discontinue the Coal Grading Board and repeal the earlier act that brought it into existence. It highlights the dynamic nature of legislative frameworks, subject to periodic review and adjustments based on changing needs, policies, and administrative considerations in the coal sector.
